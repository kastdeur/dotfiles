# Separate SSH configurations
#
# This directory contains various separate ssh configurations
# as `*.config` files.

# Ordering of various lemmas is important.
# Therefore, one can use a numeric prefix for ordering.
#
# At the time of writing, the current scheme has three priorities:
# * `35-` host   specific configurations
# * `75-` domain specific configurations
# # `99-` defaults for wildcard configurations
#
# Other prefixes can be added at will as long as the numeric ordering
# is maintained.
