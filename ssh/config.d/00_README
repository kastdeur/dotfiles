# Separate SSH configurations
#
# This directory contains various separate ssh configurations.

# Ordering of various lemmas is important. Therefore, one can use
# a numeric prefix for ordering.
#
# At the time of writing, the current scheme has two priorities:
# * `20-` domain specific configurations
# * `30-` host   specific configurations
#
# Other prefixes can be added at will as long as the numeric ordering
# is maintained.
